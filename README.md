# Learning Burn with Rust

## Introduction
I have started learning [Burn](https://burn.dev/), a deep learning framework in Rust. My goal is to explore its capabilities for machine learning and AI applications while leveraging Rust's safety, performance, and concurrency.

## Why Burn?
Burn provides a flexible and efficient deep learning framework in Rust, making it a great choice for:
- Performance-focused AI applications
- Safe and memory-efficient computations
- Seamless integration with Rust-based projects
- Backend abstraction for running models on different platforms (CPU, GPU, etc.)

## Learning Progress
### ‚úÖ Initial Setup
- Set up a Burn project
- Explored basic tensor operations

### üîÑ Current Focus
- Understanding computational graphs
- Implementing basic neural networks
- Experimenting with dataset loading and preprocessing

### ‚è≥ Next Steps
- Training a simple model on sample data
- Optimizing model performance
- Exploring integration with Actix for AI-driven web applications

## Resources
- [Burn Documentation](https://docs.burn.dev/)
- [Rust Official Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Conclusion
Burn seems like a promising tool for deep learning in Rust. As I continue learning, I aim to apply it to real-world projects and possibly integrate it with my existing Rust-based applications.

Stay tuned for updates! üöÄ
